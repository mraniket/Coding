                                         Containers
 


 Containers are odf three Type
 1) Sequence containers :-> Stores data in linear fashion (e.g. List, Vectors, Dqueue)
        ex. 7->9->11->13->15 :- list

 2) Associative Containers  :-> Direct access (e.g. Set/Multiset, Map/Multimap ) Stores data in TREE like structure
 
 3) Derived Containers  :-> Real World Modelling (e.g Stack, Queue, Priority Queue )
                                                        Stack:- Last In First Out
                                                        Queue:- First In First Out

        When to use which?

        Sequence Containers
            1)Vector :- Random Access fast/ insertion deletion Slow in middle / Insertion deletion at the end = Fast
            2)List   :- Random access slow/ insertion,deletion in middle Fast / insertion, deletion at the end fast 
            Vector is like array 

        Associative Containers :- All operations are fast except random access.

        Derived containers  :- Depends -> Data structure main dekhna padega aapko.
